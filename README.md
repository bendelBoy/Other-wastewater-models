The 2Dc software is described as 'public domain' but is not publicly available. Here is an older version of it. It came with a .NET redistributable, but that is too large for the limits of this site. If you need .NET you will have to download that from the Microsoft website. However, .NET should be standard on most current Windows releases. 2Dc models final settling tanks.
